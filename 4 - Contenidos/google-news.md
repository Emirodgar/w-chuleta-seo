Analizando tendencias, sabrás identificar los patrones cuando los veas y aprovecharás mejor el momento.

## Identificar una noticia relevante

- “Breakout” means interest in a search term grew by more than 5,000 per cent in a specific time period. Consider those keywords for headlines, URLs, within your body copy and in decks/meta descriptions.

- Consider what the audience is looking for: If your audience is national, adjust the filter for a general scope. But if it’s in your backyard, make sure you cover it with a local lens. 

## Siguientes pasos

Live blog coverage: Publish a Live quickly and refresh with substantive updates often (at least 100-150 words). The headline at publication locks in keywords you can be competitive for, so craft wisely! Look to your publication’s reporters to keep the content fresh, and check in with your opinion writers for context and analysis. 

A high cadence of updates tells readers – and Google – that it’s worth returning to this piece and keeping it in Top Stories. 

Identify breakout stories from secondary keywords that can help your publication continue to tell the story. As highlighted by Claudio E. Cabrera at NESS, Google has deprioritized Live journalism in search results in favour of more diverse content (meaning: more secondary topics and local news).

Think: Explainers, analysis, ‘What this means’-type of content. Move quickly to find those content opportunities, instead of placing all emphasis on a single Live or the main file. 

Use search to inform other content types: Timelines, maps, galleries or other formats readers want can be signalled from search data. Query attributes – phrases like “watch,” “live,” “map” or “photos” – are clear indications readers want a visual element to better understand the story. Include a gallery, video, live stream or other visual and interactive elements where possible. 

Explanatory reporting: Use keyword research to identify the main W5 (who, what, when, where, why) questions being asked in search. Answer those high-volume questions in explainers or an FAQ. This journalism often appeals to top-of-the-funnel readers – and by fulfilling that reader need, they’re better able to consume the more in-depth reporting or analysis we link out to. 

Evergreen content: What service journalism already exists on the topic? Evergreen or durable content is a great pair on the homepage or section pages.
